# Nashville-housing-data-cleaning
Data set description: The data set used in this project is taken from the publically available sources of U.S. department of housing and urban development. The data belong to the city of nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A. This project focuses on cleaning the data set and transform it into usable form to draw out useful and effective insights from it in order to understand the problems that the housing department is currently faccing in the city. The data contains various duplicate records along with some null records as well which increase its redundance and negatively affects its integrity. 

We carry out the essential cleaning and sorting procedure in SQL and fully utilize skills to creatively and effectively transform the data in the best suitable form eliminating the chances of errors in the result set. 

All of the queries applied and executed to carry out the cleaning and sorting procedure are mentioned step-by-step along with the problem description in the project file which almost removes any chances of confusion. 

This data set then further can be analyzed and tested to understand the problems that are being faced by the department of housing and urban development in the city of nashville. Thus, the learnings from the project can be applied to outher housing plans to eliminate the chances of facing such problems again in the future. 

This project descibes the sustainability of the future of housing plan.
